      <p>A city straddling two continents, alive with the call to prayer and the scent of spice markets — Istanbul defies every expectation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="post-text">
      <p>
        There is a moment, somewhere between the Blue Mosque and the Grand Bazaar, when Istanbul stops feeling like a destination and starts feeling like a world unto itself. I arrived in early June, when the city sits in that golden haze between spring and summer, and the light on the Bosphorus turns the water to hammered bronze.
      </p>
      <p>
        I had five days. It was not enough. It never is.

      <h2>Day One: The Old City</h2>
      <p>
        Begin where every visitor must — Sultanahmet, the ancient heart of the city. The Hagia Sophia rises against the sky with an authority that centuries cannot diminish. Inside, the scale is staggering. You stand at the intersection of empires — Byzantine, Ottoman — and feel the weight of a thousand years pressing gently against your shoulders.
      </p>
      <p>
        Across the plaza, the Blue Mosque earns its name the moment you step inside. Six minarets, twenty thousand Iznik tiles, and light — so much extraordinary light — pouring through two hundred and sixty windows. Photography feels inadequate. It always does in places like this.

    <div class="post-text">
      <h2>Day Two: The Grand Bazaar</h2>
      <p>
        The Grand Bazaar is not a market. It is an entire city compressed beneath one ancient roof. Sixty-one covered streets, four thousand shops, and a sensory overload so magnificent you surrender to it completely within minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lanterns hang in clusters, casting warm pools of amber across stacked bolts of silk. Vendors call out in five languages. The smell of ground coffee competes with rose water and leather. I spent four hours here. I could have spent four days.
      </p>
      <p>
        The spice market, a short walk away, is smaller but perhaps more intoxicating — pyramids of saffron, towers of dried rosebuds, sacks of sumac so deeply purple they seem to glow.

      <h2>A City Worth Coming Back To</h2>
      <p>
        On my final evening, I took a ferry across the Bosphorus to the Asian side. I sat with a glass of çay — the thin-waisted tulip glass that appears in every café, every home, every ferry crossing in Turkey — and watched Istanbul arrange itself across the horizon.
      </p>
      <p>
        Minarets needled the sky. The last light turned everything honey-gold. A city of sixteen million people, and at that moment, it felt like it belonged entirely to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will go back. Of this I am certain.
